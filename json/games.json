    "description": "2048 is a single-player puzzle game played on a grid. You slide numbered tiles around, merging them together when they touch and have the same value. Your goal is to create a tile with the number 2048, but you can keep playing for a higher score after that by creating even bigger numbers. It's a simple concept, but it gets challenging as the grid fills up and you need to strategically plan your moves.",
